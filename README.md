# Life Saver

Life Saver is an abstract, artistic implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) built with SpriteKit. With a variety of settings and color schemes, Life Saver should satisfy designers and geeks alike. Comes in two flavors: a macOS screensaver, and an Apple TV app.
