# Notes

To aid in development, technically Life Saver is a macOS app first and a screensaver second. All core files to how the thing works are in the `Life Saver` folder, and the screensaver-related junk is in the `Life Saver Screensaver` folder. Use the main `Life Saver` build target if you just want to see it run.
